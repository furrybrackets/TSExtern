# JS Internal
Writing internal cheats in JavaScript (slowly) using a web-server that can interface commands.

## How it works
Before you actually run your cheat, you have to generate a C++ file and .dll that will be injected into whatever software you want to hack. What this .dll does is open up a variety of functions that can be used whenever you want to. One downside to this approach is that you have to create a definitions file every single time you want you to add a new function.
